<h3 id="why-do-we-need-consensus">Why do we need Consensus?</h3>
<p>Consensus is an essential aspect of blockchain technology because it enables the system to reach an agreement on the state of the ledger or database without the need for a central authority. In a decentralized blockchain network, there are many nodes that maintain a copy of the database, and they need to agree on the current state of the ledger.</p>
<p>Consensus is necessary to ensure that the blockchain network remains secure and immutable. If there is no consensus mechanism in place, it would be possible for an attacker to manipulate the ledger&apos;s state by introducing fraudulent transactions. With a consensus mechanism, all nodes must agree on the validity of a <a href="../../GLOSSARY.html#transaction" class="glossary-term" title="An individual element of the state transition function of a block, such as moving tokens from one account to another.">transaction</a> before it can be added to the ledger, making it virtually impossible for an attacker to manipulate the system.</p>
<p>Consensus also helps to prevent double-spending, which is a critical issue in decentralized payment systems. Without consensus, it would be possible for a user to spend the same digital asset more than once, leading to an inconsistent ledger state. By requiring consensus on the validity of transactions, the blockchain network ensures that double-spending is prevented.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-pow-and-pos">What are PoW and PoS?</h3>
<p>PoW and PoS are two popular consensus mechanisms used in blockchain technology.</p>
<p>PoW, or <a href="../../GLOSSARY.html#proof-of-work" class="glossary-term" title="A method of achieving consensus in which the next block is determined by the first to solve a difficult puzzle (e.g., in Bitcoin, solving a partial pre-image hash for a block candidate).">Proof of Work</a>, is a consensus mechanism that requires nodes in the network to solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and create new blocks. Miners in a PoW blockchain network compete to solve these problems, and the first one to solve the puzzle earns a reward and adds a new block to the chain. PoW is used by popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, and it is known for being highly secure but energy-intensive.</p>
<p>PoS, or <a href="../../GLOSSARY.html#proof-of-stake" class="glossary-term" title="A method of achieving consensus in which the next block is determined by a node that is chosen by some characteristic (e.g., the amount of tokens that they stake).">Proof of Stake</a>, is a consensus mechanism that selects validators based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold. Validators put up a stake of their cryptocurrency as collateral, and they are selected to validate transactions and create new blocks based on the size of their stake. In a PoS blockchain network, validators are incentivized to act in the best interest of the network because they stand to lose their stake if they behave maliciously. PoS is known for being more energy-efficient than PoW because it doesn&apos;t require nodes to solve complex mathematical problems.</p>
<p>Both PoW and PoS have their advantages and disadvantages, and different blockchain networks may choose to implement one or the other depending on their specific requirements.</p>
<h3 id="nominated-proof-of-stake">Nominated Proof of Stake</h3>
<p>Nominated <a href="../../GLOSSARY.html#proof-of-stake" class="glossary-term" title="A method of achieving consensus in which the next block is determined by a node that is chosen by some characteristic (e.g., the amount of tokens that they stake).">Proof of Stake</a> (NPoS) is a variation of the <a href="../../GLOSSARY.html#proof-of-stake" class="glossary-term" title="A method of achieving consensus in which the next block is determined by a node that is chosen by some characteristic (e.g., the amount of tokens that they stake).">Proof of Stake</a> (PoS) consensus mechanism that is designed to enhance the security and decentralization of a blockchain network.</p>
<p>In a traditional PoS system, the validators are selected based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold, and they are responsible for validating transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain. However, in some PoS systems, the concentration of power among a small number of validators can pose a security risk to the network, as these validators may collude to manipulate transactions or control the network.</p>
<p>NPoS addresses this issue by allowing token holders to nominate validators on the network. This means that token holders can choose which validators they trust to validate transactions and secure the network, and they can vote to remove validators that are not acting in the network&apos;s best interest.</p>
<p>In an NPoS system, the validators are still selected based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold, but they must also be nominated by a certain number of token holders to be eligible. Validators are then chosen based on their total stake and the number of nominations they receive. This ensures that the network is decentralized, and there is a fair distribution of power among the validators.</p>

<p>Probabilistic and provable <a href="../../GLOSSARY.html#finality" class="glossary-term" title="The irreversible confirmation of a transaction or block.

<p>Probabilistic <a href="../../GLOSSARY.html#finality" class="glossary-term" title="The irreversible confirmation of a transaction or block. Once a transaction or block has been confirmed as final, it is considered permanently added to the blockchain and cannot be reversed or altered.">finality</a> is a concept used in consensus mechanisms that use probabilistic algorithms to confirm transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. In a probabilistic system, there is a small chance that a <a href="../../GLOSSARY.html#transaction" class="glossary-term" title="An individual element of the state transition function of a block, such as moving tokens from one account to another.">transaction</a> may be reversed or a block may be orphaned if there is a competing chain with more computational power. This is because the blockchain network may occasionally experience forks or temporary reorganizations, but these are quickly resolved as the network continues to add new blocks.</p>
<p>In contrast, provable <a href="../../GLOSSARY.html#finality" class="glossary-term" title="The irreversible confirmation of a transaction or block. Once a transaction or block has been confirmed as final, it is considered permanently added to the blockchain and cannot be reversed or altered.">finality</a> is a concept used in consensus mechanisms that provide mathematical proof that a <a href="../../GLOSSARY.html#transaction" class="glossary-term" title="An individual element of the state transition function of a block, such as moving tokens from one account to another.">transaction</a> is confirmed and cannot be reversed. In a provable system, once a block is added to the blockchain, it is considered final and cannot be modified or reversed. This is achieved through the use of cryptographic techniques such as digital signatures and hash functions, which ensure that any changes to a block would invalidate the cryptographic signatures of subsequent blocks.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the choice between probabilistic and provable <a href="../../GLOSSARY.html#finality" class="glossary-term" title="The irreversible confirmation of a transaction or block. Once a transaction or block has been confirmed as final, it is considered permanently added to the blockchain and cannot be reversed or altered.">finality</a> depends on the specific requirements of the blockchain network and the trade-offs between security, scalability, and efficiency.</p>

<p>In this mechanism, validators with a stake of cryptocurrency are responsible for creating new blocks and validating transactions on the network.

<li>Block Verification: Once the block proposal is created, it is broadcasted to the other authorities in the network for verification. The other authorities validate the proposed block, ensuring it meets the consensus rules and does not conflict with the existing blockchain state.</li>
<li>Block Commitment: If the proposed block is approved by the majority or a predetermined threshold of the other authorities, it is considered valid and committed to the blockchain. The block is added to the blockchain, and the leader&apos;s turn is completed.</li>
<li>Round Progression: After the block commitment, the round proceeds to the next authority in the predefined order, and the process repeats. Each authority takes turns being the leader, proposing blocks, and receiving verification from the other authorities.</li>
