 \n  \n\n\nWhat is GGX Chain?\nGGX chain is the interchain infrastructure protocol that utilizes Multi-Party Computation (MPC) for interoperable communication and advanced liquidity routing over a network of decentralized independent sub-chains.\nGGX chain is built to connect arbitrary chains with each other turning sharded environment into the internet of blockchains.\nWhy GGX Chain?\nGGX chain is an interchain communication platform, allowing you to send messages and liquidity from one blockchain to another. GGX chain is also a smart contract platform, utilizing a hybrid virtual machine. GGX chain's hybrid virtual machine allows users to program in Solidity as well as any general purpose programming language that can be compiled into the WASM (e.g. Rust, Javascript).\nWe provide agnostic base layer communication, modern security techniques and zero-knowledge precompiles, providing the richest environment for dapps development, especially for dapps that require cross-chain communication.\n"},"developer-documentation/architecture/accounts-and-transactions.html":{"url":"developer-documentation/architecture/accounts-and-transactions.html","title":"Accounts and Transactions","keywords":"","body":"Accounts and Transactions\nIn the context of blockchain, a transaction refers to a fundamental unit of activity that occurs on a blockchain network. It represents a transfer or exchange of data or value between participants in the network (accounts).\nOn GGX chain, accounts are entities used to represent individuals or entities that own and transact with GGX tokens on the blockchain. Accounts are similar to bank accounts in traditional finance, where they hold assets and facilitate transactions. Each account on GGX chain has a unique address which is a string of characters that identifies the account on the blockchain. The address is derived from the account's public key and is used to sign transactions and verify the account's ownership of tokens. Accounts in GGX chain can be of two types:\n\nExternal accounts: These accounts are owned by individuals or entities and are not associated with any specific smart contract or on-chain identity. External accounts can hold tokens and can participate in transactions on the blockchain.\nContract accounts are associated with smart contracts on the blockchain and are used to store and manage contract states. Contract accounts can execute code and interact with other contracts and external accounts. Accounts in GGX chain can be managed by users using their private keys. For example, users can sign transactions with their private keys to transfer tokens from their accounts or interact with smart contracts.\n\nAccounts can also be managed by on-chain governance mechanisms, such as council members or validators, who can execute transactions on behalf of the account.\nOverall, accounts are a fundamental concept in Substrate and are essential for managing token ownership and transactions on the blockchain.\n"},"developer-documentation/architecture/consensus.html":{"url":"developer-documentation/architecture/consensus.html","title":"Consensus","keywords":"","body":"Consensus\nWhy do we need Consensus?\nConsensus is an essential aspect of blockchain technology because it enables the system to reach an agreement on the state of the ledger or database without the need for a central authority. In a decentralized blockchain network, there are many nodes that maintain a copy of the database, and they need to agree on the current state of the ledger.\nConsensus is necessary to ensure that the blockchain network remains secure and immutable. If there is no consensus mechanism in place, it would be possible for an attacker to manipulate the ledger's state by introducing fraudulent transactions. With a consensus mechanism, all nodes must agree on the validity of a transaction before it can be added to the ledger, making it virtually impossible for an attacker to manipulate the system.\nConsensus also helps to prevent double-spending, which is a critical issue in decentralized payment systems. Without consensus, it would be possible for a user to spend the same digital asset more than once, leading to an inconsistent ledger state. By requiring consensus on the validity of transactions, the blockchain network ensures that double-spending is prevented.\nWhat are PoW and PoS?\nPoW and PoS are two popular consensus mechanisms used in blockchain technology.\nPoW, or Proof of Work, is a consensus mechanism that requires nodes in the network to solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and create new blocks. Miners in a PoW blockchain network compete to solve these problems, and the first one to solve the puzzle earns a reward and adds a new block to the chain. PoW is used by popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, and it is known for being highly secure but energy-intensive.\nPoS, or Proof of Stake, is a consensus mechanism that selects validators based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold. Validators put up a stake of their cryptocurrency as collateral, and they are selected to validate transactions and create new blocks based on the size of their stake. In a PoS blockchain network, validators are incentivized to act in the best interest of the network because they stand to lose their stake if they behave maliciously. PoS is known for being more energy-efficient than PoW because it doesn't require nodes to solve complex mathematical problems.\nBoth PoW and PoS have their advantages and disadvantages, and different blockchain networks may choose to implement one or the other depending on their specific requirements.\nNominated Proof of Stake\nNominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) is a variation of the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism that is designed to enhance the security and decentralization of a blockchain network.\nIn a traditional PoS system, the validators are selected based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold, and they are responsible for validating transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain. However, in some PoS systems, the concentration of power among a small number of validators can pose a security risk to the network, as these validators may collude to manipulate transactions or control the network.\nNPoS addresses this issue by allowing token holders to nominate validators on the network. This means that token holders can choose which validators they trust to validate transactions and secure the network, and they can vote to remove validators that are not acting in the network's best interest.\nIn an NPoS system, the validators are still selected based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold, but they must also be nominated by a certain number of token holders to be eligible. Validators are then chosen based on their total stake and the number of nominations they receive. This ensures that the network is decentralized, and there is a fair distribution of power among the validators.\nProbabilistic vs. Provable Finality\nProbabilistic and provable finality are two different approaches to achieving finality in blockchain networks.\nProbabilistic finality is a concept used in consensus mechanisms that use probabilistic algorithms to confirm transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. In a probabilistic system, there is a small chance that a transaction may be reversed or a block may be orphaned if there is a competing chain with more computational power. This is because the blockchain network may occasionally experience forks or temporary reorganizations, but these are quickly resolved as the network continues to add new blocks.\nIn contrast, provable finality is a concept used in consensus mechanisms that provide mathematical proof that a transaction is confirmed and cannot be reversed. In a provable system, once a block is added to the blockchain, it is considered final and cannot be modified or reversed. This is achieved through the use of cryptographic techniques such as digital signatures and hash functions, which ensure that any changes to a block would invalidate the cryptographic signatures of subsequent blocks.\nProvable finality is considered to be more secure and reliable than probabilistic finality because it provides a higher level of confidence that transactions are confirmed and cannot be reversed. However, provable finality may require more computational resources than probabilistic finality, and it may be more difficult to achieve in highly decentralized networks.\nUltimately, the choice between probabilistic and provable finality depends on the specific requirements of the blockchain network and the trade-offs between security, scalability, and efficiency.\nHybrid Consensus\nHybrid consensus with POS block production and the finality gadget is a consensus mechanism that combines Proof of Stake (PoS) for block production and the finality gadget for provable finality in a blockchain network.\nIn this mechanism, validators with a stake of cryptocurrency are responsible for creating new blocks and validating transactions on the network. Validators are chosen based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold and are incentivized to act in the best interest of the network because they stand to lose their stake if they behave maliciously.\nThe finality gadget is then used to provide provable finality to the network. It works by using Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) algorithms to ensure that once a block is added to the blockchain, it is considered final and cannot be modified or reversed.\nThe combination of PoS block production and the finality gadget provides a secure and efficient consensus mechanism for blockchain networks. It is known for being energy-efficient compared to PoW-based systems and provides fast transaction finality, making it suitable for applications that require high throughput and low latency.\nBlock Production: AURA\nAURA (Authority Round) is a block production algorithm used in the GGX chain network.\nIn the AURA algorithm, a designated set of authorities or validators take turns producing blocks in a round-robin fashion. The authorities are typically trusted participants within the network, such as known organizations or entities.\nThe block production process in AURA involves the following steps:\n\nSelection of Leader: At the beginning of each round, a leader or primary authority is selected. The selection process can be predetermined or based on a specific criterion, such as a rotating schedule or a voting mechanism.\nBlock Proposal: The selected leader creates a new block proposal containing transactions that are to be included in the next block. This block proposal may undergo a validation process by other authorities to ensure its integrity and adherence to predefined rules.\nBlock Verification: Once the block proposal is created, it is broadcasted to the other authorities in the network for verification. The other authorities validate the proposed block, ensuring it meets the consensus rules and does not conflict with the existing blockchain state.\nBlock Commitment: If the proposed block is approved by the majority or a predetermined threshold of the other authorities, it is considered valid and committed to the blockchain. The block is added to the blockchain, and the leader's turn is completed.\nRound Progression: After the block commitment, the round proceeds to the next authority in the predefined order, and the process repeats. Each authority takes turns being the leader, proposing blocks, and receiving verification from the other authorities.\n\nThe AURA algorithm leverages the trust and reputation of the designated authorities to facilitate block production and maintain consensus within the network.\nFinality Gadget: GRANDPA\nThe GRANDPA finality gadget is used to provide provable finality to the blocks in the Polkadot chain. It works by using a GHOST (Greedy Heaviest Observed Subtree) algorithm to determine the final consensus of the network. The GHOST algorithm takes into account the weight of the blocks in the chain to determine which blocks are the heaviest and have the most support from the network.\nOnce the GHOST algorithm has determined the heaviest chain, GRANDPA uses a recursive process to derive a prefix of this chain that has the support of the majority of the network. This prefix is then considered final and cannot be modified or reversed.\nThe GRANDPA finality gadget is designed to be efficient and scalable, making it suitable for high-throughput applications. Its use of a recursive process allows it to quickly determine the final consensus of the network, and its use of a prefix ensures that only a small portion of the blockchain needs to be finalized, reducing the time and resources required for finality.\nOverall, the GRANDPA finality gadget is an important component of the GGX chain network's consensus mechanism, ensuring fast and secure transactions across multiple chains.\nResources\n\nGRANDPA paper - The academic description of the GRANDPA finality gadget.

For better security and advanced users, it is recommended to use node-based methods or the Subkey tool. Multisig and Proxied accounts can be easily created using the Explorer UI. EVM-based keys can be created by using Metamask and other EVM-compatible wallets.\nSupported Key Standards\nGGX chain supports the following key standards for its accounts:\ned25519\nThis format is required for running a validator node. However, conversion between sr25519 and ed25519 is not straightforward since they are different elliptic curve systems. They have different mathematical foundations and converting a private key from one to the other can compromise security.\nIt is recommended to use sr25519 or EVM-based keys for end users rather than ed25519.\nsr25519\nAlso known as Schnorr/Ristretto 25519. An elliptic curve cryptography algorithm optimized for Substrate-based chains, providing efficient signature verification. sr25519 provides a high level of security and resistance against various attacks.\nEVM-based keys (H160) - Recommended for end users\nIt is the easiest and versatile key format, that can be used by EVM-compatible wallets including Metamask. It is a 160-bit hash of the public key, which is used as an address in EVM-based chains. It is also known as an Ethereum address. H160 keys are a good choice for end users, as they are easy to use and compatible with EVM-based wallets.\nConverting Keys\nAs it is not directly possible to convert between sr25519 and ed25519 keys, it is recommended to create a new key pair for the desired key standard. However, it is possible to convert between sr25519/ed25519 and EVM-based keys. By using Keccak-256 function to generate hash from a public key and taking the rightmost 20 bytes of the hash, it is possible to get the H160 representation of the key.\nValidator Node Keys\nFor running a validator node, GGX requires two types of keys: Stash Account and Controller Account keys. The Stash key holds the funds and is used for nominating other validators, while the Controller key is used to control the validator node and manage nominations. The recommnded way to generate validator node key is by running a node and using its tools. For more information, see the instructions for making a key using the Node.\nMultisig Addresses\nGGX chain supports multisig addresses, which require multiple signatures to approve transactions or changes on the chain. To create a multisig address, you need the public keys of all signatories involved in the multisig account. A multisig address can be useful for joint accounts or organizations that require consensus for transactions.\nWays to Generate Keys\nFor better security, advanced users, and validators it is recommended to use node-based methods or the Subkey tool.\n\nNode (recommended, especially for Validator keys)\nSubkey (CLI tool)\nPolkadot JS API (requires scripting)\nMetamask Extension (UI-based, H160 keys only)\nPolkadot.js Extension (UI-based, no EVM support)\nGGX Explorer UI (UI-based.

Sydney testnet is a Proof-of-Stake network based on the GGX chain blockchain.\nGGX chain team holds privileged access to the network having the authority to upgrade and configure the network solely. We configured it this way to ensure failover in case of any emergency. We plan to revoke this access after the network gains enough maturity. Any usage of privileged access by the GGX chain team will be transparent and evident to other network participants. GGX chain team is not incentivized to use privileged access unless in an emergency.\nSydney testnet includes democracy routines. Any validator can propose a network upgrade or tokenomics parameter changes. The proposal will be the subject of voting by all Validators that have the minimum amount of tokens staked (1000 GGXT). The proposal is accepted/rejected by a simple majority rule.\nValidator Incentives\n\nRewards - Validators in the Sydney network have the opportunity to earn rewards in the form of GGXT tokens. By staking and participating in the consensus mechanism, validators can receive regular rewards for their contribution to securing and maintaining the network.\nGovernance and Influence - Validators play a vital role in the decentralized governance of the Sydney network. They have the power to vote on proposals and influence the direction of the network's development and upgrades. Participating as a validator allows individuals and organizations to have a say in the decision-making process and contribute to shaping the future of the network.\nCommunity and Collaboration - Participating as a validator provides an opportunity to engage with like-minded individuals and collaborate on projects and initiatives related to the Sydney network. It allows for knowledge sharing, networking, and building relationships with others in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space.\nLearning and Technical Experience - Operating a validator node in the Sydney network requires technical knowledge and infrastructure setup. Participating as a validator can be a learning experience, allowing individuals and organizations to deepen their understanding of blockchain technology, consensus mechanisms, and network operations.\nSupporting the Network: Validators play a crucial role in the security and integrity of the Sydney network. By participating as a validator, individuals and organizations contribute to the network's overall health and resilience. Validators help ensure the network is secure, transactions are validated, and consensus is reached, thereby fostering trust and reliability in the Sydney ecosystem. Network quality directly affects GGXT token value.\n\nParticipation workflow and requirements \nTo participate in The GGX chain Sydney validator programme you need to do the following:\n\nContact GGX Team to acquire permission and GGXT tokens\nSet up a Validator node following the instruction. \nStake tokens.\nMaintain your node.\n\n"},"sydney-testnet/sydney-bug-bounty-program.html":{"url":"sydney-testnet/sydney-bug-bounty-program.html","title":"Sydney Bug Bounty Program","keywords":"","body":"Sydney Bug Bounty Program\nNOTE: The start date of the Sydney Bug Bounty Program has yet to be announced!

They are generally designed to be open-source, transparent, and resistant to censorship, making them a promising development in the field of blockchain technology.\nExtrinsic\nA property or characteristic of a function or method that depends on external factors, such as its input parameters or its environment.\nThese properties can affect the behavior of a function or method, but they are not inherent to the function itself. For example, the output of a function may depend on a variable or value that is passed in as an argument.\nFinality\nThe irreversible confirmation of a transaction or block. Once a transaction or block has been confirmed as final, it is considered permanently added to the blockchain and cannot be reversed or altered.\nGRANDPA\nGHOST-based Recursive ANcestor Deriving Prefix Agreement is a mechanism used in the GGX network to achieve fast and secure finality. It is a Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus algorithm that works in conjunction with the AURO block production mechanism to provide finality for GGX Network.\nGovernance\nThe process of determining what changes to the network are permissible, such as modifications to code or movement of funds. In GGX the governing system is on-chain and revolves around validator voting.\nLIBP2P\nAn open-source library for encrypted peer-to-peer communications and other networking functionality. More information at: https://libp2p.io/\nLiveness\nThe property of a distributed system is that it will eventually come to some sort of consensus. A system stuck in an infinite loop would not be considered live, even if computations are taking place; a system that eventually provides a result, even if incorrect or it takes a long time, is considered to be live.\nNominator\nUsers that select a set of validators to stake to. A certain amount of $GGX must be staked in order to do so, which may be lost if the validator behaves badly. This forces nominators to carefully select validators.\nOn-Chain Governance\nGovernance of a blockchain which is controlled by the blockchain. Allows for decisions can be made transparently. Note that there are a variety of different algorithms for making these decisions, such as simple majority voting or identity-based quadratic voting.\nProof of Stake\nA method of achieving consensus in which the next block is determined by a node that is chosen by some characteristic (e.g., the amount of tokens that they stake).\nProof of Work\nA method of achieving consensus in which the next block is determined by the first to solve a difficult puzzle (e.g., in Bitcoin, solving a partial pre-image hash for a block candidate).\nRuntime\nA state transition function indicates a valid algorithm for determining the state of the next block given the previous block.\nRuntime Module\nWebAssembly code which encodes a state transition function.\nSafety\nThe property of a distributed system indicates that the system will properly meet all invariants; that is, that nothing \"bad\" ever happens to the data (such as it being corrupted).\nSession Certificate\nAnother name for the session \"key\" which is a BLS key for GRANDPA, a sr25519 key for AURA, and eventually an Ed25519 key for libp2p.\nSession key\nA session \"key\" is a BLS key for GRANDPA, a sr25519 key for AURA, and eventually an Ed25519 key for libp2p.\nSolidity\nSolidity is a high-level programming language specifically designed for writing smart contracts on blockchain platforms, primarily Ethereum. It is one of the most widely used languages for developing decentralized applications (dApps) and executing smart contracts within the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\nStaking\nA lock-up mechanism which requires a certain amount of $GGX tokens to participate in network consensus and governance. Staking is a key mechanism in the Golden Gate ecosystem, as it helps secure the network and enables token holders to vote in the decision-making process.\nStash Account\nThe primary account that holds a user's $GGX tokens and is used for staking and nominating on the network. When a user wants to participate in staking and nominating activities, they must first transfer their $GGX tokens to their stash account.\nState Transition Function\nA function which describes how the state of a blockchain can be transformed. For example, it may describe how tokens can be transferred from one account to another.\nSubstrate\nAn open-source modular framework for building custom blockchain networks and decentralized applications (dApps). It is developed by Parity Technologies and is designed to be flexible, scalable, and easy to use. It provides a set of pre-built modules that developers can use to create customized blockchain networks and dApps. These modules include functionality for consensus, networking, storage, governance, and more, allowing developers to quickly build and launch their own blockchain-based projects.\nTransaction\nAn individual element of the state transition function of a block, such as moving tokens from one account to another.\nValidator\nA node securing the relay chain by staking $GGX, validating proofs from collators on parachains, and determining a consensus along with other validators.\nVoting\nThe process of stakeholders determining whether or not a referendum to implement a specific proposal should pass.\nWallet\nA program that allows one to store, receive, and transmit $GGX or other blockchain-based tokens.\nWebAssembly\nAn instruction format for a virtual, stack-based machine. Polkadot Runtime Modules are compiled into WebAssembly. Also known as Wasm.\nWitness\nCryptographic proof statements of data validity.\n"}}}
